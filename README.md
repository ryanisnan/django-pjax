# django-pjax

This is a Django helper for [defunkt’s jquery-pjax].

Django-PJAX requires Django 1.3.


## Credits

This project is an extension of [Django-PJAX] and all credits from the original version goes to [Jacob Kaplan-Moss].


## About

This project keeps the original structure, but add new features to it, and aims to keep django-pjax updated.
Some goals are to keep this project working with Python 2.7+ and 3.3+ and also Django 1.5+, some not supported yet.

Feel free to submit a PR and contribute to this project.

## What’s PJAX?

PJAX is essentially [AHAH] ("Asynchronous HTML and HTTP"), except with real permalinks and a working back button.
It lets you load just a portion of a page (so things are faster) while still maintaining the usability of real links.

A demo makes more sense, so [check out the one defunkt put together].


## Usage

First, read about [how to use jQuery-PJAX][defunkt’s jquery-pjax] and pick one of the techniques there.

Next, make sure the views you’re PJAXing are using [TemplateResponse]. You can’t use Django-PJAX with a normal `HttpResponse`; only `TemplateResponse`.

Decorate these views with the `pjax` decorator:

```python
from djpjax import pjax

@pjax()
def my_view(request):
    return TemplateResponse(request, "template.html", {'my': 'context'})
```

After doing this, if the request is made via jQuery-PJAX, the `@pjax()` decorator will automatically swap out `template.html` for `template-pjax.html`.

More formally: if the request is a PJAX request, the template used in your `TemplateResponse` will be replaced with one with `-pjax` before the file extension.
So `template.html` becomes `template-pjax.html`, `my.template.xml` becomes `my.template-pjax.xml`, etc.
If there’s no file extension, the template name will just be suffixed with `-pjax`.

You can also manually pick a PJAX template by passing it as an argument to the decorator:

```python
from djpjax import pjax

@pjax("pjax.html")
def my_view(request):
    return TemplateResponse(request, "template.html", {'my': 'context'})
```

You can also pick a PJAX template for a PJAX container and use multiple decorators to define the template for multiple containers:

```python
from djpjax import pjax

@pjax("pjax.html") # This is the default template.
@pjax("pjax_inner.html", "#pjax-inner-content") # This is the template for #pjax-inner-content.
def my_view(request):
    return TemplateResponse(request, "template.html", {'my': 'context'})
```

If you’d like to use Django 1.3’s class-based views instead, a PJAX Mixin class is provided as well.
Simply use `PJAXResponseMixin` where you would normally have used `TemplateResponseMixin`, and your `template_name` will be treated the same way as above.

You can alternately provide a `pjax_template_name` class variable if you want a specific template used for PJAX responses:

```python
from django.views.generic import View
from djpjax import PJAXResponseMixin

class MyView(PJAXResponseMixin, View):
    template_name = "template.html"
    pjax_template_name = "pjax.html"

    def get(self, request):
        return self.render_to_response({'my': 'context'})
```

That’s it!


## Using Template Extensions

If the content in your `template-pjax.html` file is very similar to your `template.html` an alternative method of operation is to use the decorator `pjaxtend`, as follows:

```python
from djpjax import pjaxtend

@pjaxtend
def my_view(request):
    return TemplateResponse(request, "template.html", {'my': 'context'})
```

Then, in your `template.html` file you can do the following:

```
{% extends parent %}
...
...
```

Note that the template will extend `base.html` unless its a pjax request in which case it will extend `pjax.html`.

If you want to define the parent for a standard http or pjax request, you can do so as follows:

```python
from djpjax import pjaxtend

@pjaxtend('someapp/base.html', 'my-pjax-extension.html')
def my_view(request):
    return TemplateResponse(request, "template.html", {'my': 'context'})
```

Using this approach you don’t need to create many `*-pjax.html` files.

If you have a collision with the variable name `parent` you can specify the context variable to use as the third parameter to pjaxtexd, as follows:

```python
from djpjax import pjaxtend

@pjaxtend('someapp/base.html', 'my-pjax-extension.html', 'my_parent')
def my_view(request):
    return TemplateResponse(request, "template.html", {'my': 'context'})
```

Which would require the following in your template:

```
{% extends my\_parent %}
...
...
```
